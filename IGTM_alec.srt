1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,820
Yeah.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:43,620
One of the main things about how I operate my business is that I believe games are art.

3
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,460
Some people say that games can't be art because they believe that they are simply a lower

4
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,140
form of entertainment.

5
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,740
My belief is that they can't not be art.

6
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,780
It's really impossible for it not to be art.

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:04,460
Hi, I'm Alec Kaloka from Infinite Ammo Incorporated, and I make games.

8
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,460
I have a kind of weird family.

9
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,540
We all kind of do creative stuff together, so as a kid, like, my dad would get us to

10
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,180
make board games together.

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,060
We'd actually draw the boards, we'd draw the cards, we'd make up the rules, and my dad

12
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,400
was actually a big influence in getting me into game programming because he bought me

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,420
a book called Basic Fun when I was eight years old and invited one of my cousins over to

14
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,500
help teach me if statements, which are one of the fundamental aspects of programming,

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
basically.

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
If one thing is happening, do this.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,420
Else, do something else.

18
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,700
And we made this little maze game together where you walk through a maze with little

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,020
animations just done with text characters.

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,420
And so that was sort of the first time I actually had made anything.

21
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,340
The real cool thing about games is that it's like a fusion of visual stuff, audio stuff,

22
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,340
interactive stuff like board games and rule sets all into one.

23
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,860
And so what I'm really interested in is how do all those things work together to create

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,780
a cohesive experience.

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,220
So the projects that I have been involved with and am involved with include Aquaria,

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,620
Paper Moon, Heroes and Villains for the iPhone, Marion, hopefully for the Xbox.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Aquaria was a game that I released in 2007.

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,020
It was created by myself and my friend Derek Yu, who is from San Francisco.

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,380
Basically it was me sort of working by myself and interacting with Derek on the internet.

30
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,620
So a lot of the experience of developing this by myself and being alone in an apartment

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,700
kind of worked its way into the story of the game.

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,580
So the main character of the game is Nyjah, who is a character who is totally alone in

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,860
this really beautiful underwater world and has to find out who she is and what her purpose

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,420
is.

35
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,020
The game went on to win the Seamus McNally Grand Prize Award at the Independent Games

36
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,620
Festival, which was like a huge moment.

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,860
It was really interesting because my dad was actually there.

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,180
He flew down from Winnipeg to go to San Francisco to see these awards.

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,980
He was the one who got me into games as a kid.

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,380
There was always this tension between us of sort of like, you know, you always have to

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,820
prove to your father that you can do something.

42
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,900
I remember it came down to the part where the team that won last year came out and started

43
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
to introduce the award.

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,980
I remember thinking to myself, this is like a Back to the Future 2 moment where Doc Brown

45
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,460
is saying that the timelines are going to diverge in two different directions.

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:26,140
If we win the award, it's going to be a completely different thing than if we don't.

47
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,500
So fortunately, we won.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,300
It was a brain-shattering moment because I almost couldn't process it.

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
What?

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:44,580
Being an independent game developer requires a ton of different skills because you don't

51
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,220
have a boatload of money that you can just throw at people to do stuff for you.

52
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,620
So one of the things that Infinite Ammo does to survive and operate as a company in the

53
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,980
indie game space is collaborate with a lot of different people who are all over the place.

54
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm collaborating on a number of iPhone game projects, one's with a guy in Chicago, one's

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,260
with a guy called Phil Fish in Montreal.

56
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,700
I'm looking at doing another one with a guy from Britain.

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,180
So really it's this community that spans the globe.

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,580
It's this really close, trusted network of creative individuals who work together to

59
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,580
create unique stuff.

60
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
Yes!

61
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:31,940
Winnipeg's kind of the butt of a lot of jokes, and that's fine because indie game developers

62
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,500
are always kind of the underdog, and Winnipeg's kind of like a perpetual underdog.

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,540
So I think it's a good match.

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,580
I grew up here, I spent most of my life here, and lots of elements of the city are ingrained

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,780
in my mind in both real and imaginary ways, like the ways I saw them as a kid.

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,660
So this sense of old architecture, this sense of strange toys, all kinds of things that

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,700
have influenced me to want to explore certain things in the games that I make.

68
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,220
I would like Infinite Ammo to be known for both games that are fun to pick up and play

69
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,900
and just enjoy, and also games that are really deep that you can dive into and get lost in.

70
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,300
And they're both completely different things.

71
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,100
So it's kind of an interesting point because I'm developing a number of games that are

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,540
short and fun and easy to pick up and play, and I'm developing this other game that's

73
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:27,220
this huge, sprawling epic that hopefully people will be able to lose themselves in.

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,740
I'd like to be able to do both, whether that's possible or not is another question.
