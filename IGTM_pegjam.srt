00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We are in TigJam Winnipeg. We are here with like 20, 30 other game developers.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
TigJam is the independent game jam. It's kind of formed out of the TigSource online community.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Everybody's making amazing things.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Basically everyone just brings a laptop, works on whatever they feel like working on,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
whether it's like a new project or something they've been working on for a long time.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You push all that other stuff out and for two days you work really, really hard to usually make a new thing

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that somehow you either needed an excuse to make or you had no idea you were going to make in the first place,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but it sort of captured your imagination.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
At the jam, my jam game started out as like four different games.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Today I've been working on a thing that has no name yet.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I coded this like circular room.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You are a guy with a jet pack.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, the guy will have like a sword thing.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And you fly around.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You'll be able to swing this sword thing around.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And shoot things.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And it gets thinner as it's longer, that kind of thing.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And then you can land and dash at stuff.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It evolved into this cool project with suggestions from all these different people

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
where I'm actually trying out a cool mechanic and trying out a cool intuitive way of moving,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that kind of thing.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a lot of different things that haven't quite come together yet.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I made a little skier game.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to make a game that's like a ragdoll track and field kind of game.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So you're kind of this little skier ragdoll puppet guy.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And if you move the mouse up, he moves up.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you move the mouse down, he moves down.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And then you can kind of move the mouse around to control him.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And it flips and move up.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I started this yesterday.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's reasonably playable for what it is.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So rather than mash buttons really hard and really fast to do stuff,

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you kind of puppeteer these little ragdoll characters.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's this game called QWOP that did this.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But QWOP made something easy really difficult.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I want to make things that are difficult really easy.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Like it's really hard to go skiing and do a double front flip.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But it's pretty easy to do it in a game.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And that's kind of where the fun is.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I think that's the better approach.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I wanted to prototype some ideas for that.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You learn a ton just by hanging out in this kind of environment

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
because people are just viewing useful information about game making all the time.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, you get this sort of exchange of ideas that you don't necessarily...

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a lot more raw in your person than just reading things on forums.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It changes how you develop games.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It turns them into this social thing,

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
this thing where you share your ideas openly with people.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think it's supposed to remind us that, yeah, you can do whatever you want for two days.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Like that's the goal of it is just to do whatever you want

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
as opposed to, oh, I have to get this next feature set for this next milestone,

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
for this next funding payment or whatever it is.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I know it's a great opportunity to bring everybody together

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
because we're all spread out all over the world.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's great to be in the same place and meet up with everybody again.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's amazing to be in a room with people doing wonderful things.
